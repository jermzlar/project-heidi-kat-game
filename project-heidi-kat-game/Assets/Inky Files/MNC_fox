Much to your surprise, the station corridors are largely empty. You would've thought people would be running around in panic and chaos after such a disaster, and yet you appear to be the only one traversing these lonely halls. Occasionally you see bodies--the mangled corpses of those unfortunate enough to have perished in the blast or shortly after. You could count yourself lucky not to be one of them; although, considering you appear to have been left behind, you're not certain luck factors into it.

As you make your way through Cassio, a thought begins to creep into the back of your mind. It would have taken time to evacuate everyone from the station. How long were you unconscious, then? It must have been more than hours for the station to be this empty. And why weren't you evacuated? Did nobody bother with the courtesy of checking your pulse before declaring you a lost cause?

The questions pile up in your mind until you can't think anymore and a rush of dizziness sweeps over you. You stop just outside the entrance to the shuttle port and grip the wall, waiting as your vision hazes for it to pass. After a moment, it does, and you continue inside, noting that you should probably {intro.doctor or intro.unconventional_medic or intro.combat_medic or intro.medicine: take care of your head injury|get your head looked at} soon.

Seven of the ten docking bays are completely locked down and inaccessible to you without proper authorization, but there are some you can still access.

//met Athen, has weapon

There is not sight nor sound of anyone else around in the main hall. Then comes the echo of a pistol shot fired from one of the bays at the end; the only one not locked down is Docking Bay 1E.

You tighten your grip on the weapon in your hand as you walk towards the end of the hall and think about your plan.

As soon as you open the doors to Bay 1E, your presence will be announced to whoever is inside. How do you wish to approach the situation?

    *[Shoot first, ask questions later.]
        Given that whoever's in there has already shot at least one person today, you feel it is in your best interest to make sure your first impression contains an abundance of aggression.
        
      The doors to the bay slide open at your touch. You waste no time sighting your target, a young man with olive skin who is just turning around as you fire your first warning shots {combat skill > 64: right above his head|near his feet}. He {combat skill > 64: ducks|jumps} and curses loudly.
      
      "What--what the hell is that for?" he yells, drawing his own pistol and training it on you.
      
            **["That was a warning."]
                "Consider it a warning of things to come if you want to try anything on me like what you did to that poor man Athen," you say threateningly, moving further into the docking bay.

            **["You can dish it out, but you can't take it."]
                "Oh, I see, so you can dish it out, but you can't take it," you quip, moving further into the docking bay.
                
                "I don't even know you!" the man says incredulously.
                
                "I'm not talking about me," you say, frustrated. "I saw what you did to that poor man Athen."
                
            --"'Poor Athen?'" he repeats, then adds as an afterthought, "I'm kind of surprised he's still alive, honestly."
                
                "He won't be for long, thanks to you."
                
                "I suppose, in his retelling of the events that led to me shooting him, he neglected to mention the part where he was going to murder me first?"
                
                "Well--" you start, but you've suddenly found yourself on uncertain ground. Finally, you admit, "No, he sort of skipped that part."
                
                "How about you put down your pistol and I'll put down my pistol and we'll both talk about this like civilized people?" the man says.
                
                "How can I trust you? What if you're lying?"
                
                "Listen, of the two of us, I am not the one who has shot at a stranger today with zero pretense or cause," he points out.
                
                "I wouldn't say zero cause," you are quick to add.
                
                As a gesture of good faith, he lowers his pistol and holsters it, holding out his hands in a show of insouciance. You follow his lead, albeit a bit more slowly.
                
                "I'll start. I'm Fox. Who're you?"

                "{player_name}," you reply cautiously. "Explain what you're doing here and why you shot Athen."

    *[Give whoever is inside the benefit of the doubt.]
    
        You keep your pistol by your side as the doors open to the touch of your hand. It's only a moment before you spot the olive-skinned man near the only ship in the bay. He trains his pistol on you threateningly, but you only lift a hand in a show of meaning no harm.
        
        "What do you want?" he asks, clearly uncertain what he should make of you.
        
        "Just to talk. I have some questions," you say, honestly hoping that's all this will be.
        
        The man narrows his eyes.
        
        "About what?" 
    
        "Well, I saw what you did to that poor man, Athen," you say.
        
        "'Poor Athen?'" the man says incredulously. "He's clearly lied to you as well, then. I suppose in his retelling of the events that led to me shooting him, he neglected to mention the part where he was going to murder me first?"
        
        You chew on this new information for a moment before responding.
        
        "Er, no, he sort of skipped that part," you admit finally, and continue, "If it's true, that is. How can I trust you're not lying?"
        
        The man flashes an imp-like smile that is, admittedly, exceedingly charming.
        
        "As you come to know me you'll learn that I detest lies and deceit," he says. "And, I do hope you will come to know me," he adds, taking a step closer to you.
        
            **[Let's see if he can take it as good as he dishes it out.]
            
                "I certainly hope I will come," you say slyly, and then with perfect innocence, "To know you, that is."
                
                At this, he looks utterly delighted.
                
                "We can start with a first-name basis," he says. "I'm Fox. Who're you?"
                
                "{player_name}," you reply. "And I'd actually like to start with what you're doing here, and why you shot Athen."
            
            **[Big yikes.]
            
                "Keep that up and I will find a reason to shoot you," you say with no small amount of warning.
                
                "Message received," he replies, tapping his nose knowingly. "Let's just go with a first-name basis, then. I'm Fox. Who're you?"
                
                "{player_name}," you reply. "Tell me what you're doing here, and why you shot Athen."
    
    *[I'll be cautious, but have my weapon ready.]
    
      Taking cover by the frame of the door, you use a moment to breath deeply and try to steady your hands. You're still feeling the effects of an untreated head injury, so your aim will likely be off. Best to be quick about it, then, if it comes to that.
        
        The doors slide open at your touch and you peer around the corner of the frame just as someone calls out, "Who's there?"
        
        "Are you the person who shot Athen?" you ask.
        
        There is a beat before they reply.
        
        "... Yes. What do you want?" they call back.
        
        "Just to talk. I have some questions," you say, and you honestly hope that's all it will come to.
        
        You peak around the corner of the frame and spot the speaker: a young man with olive skin. He's currently holding his pistol up in the general direction of the door. His eyes widen as he spots you and you quickly pull back to safety.
        
        "If you just have some questions, why are you hiding?" he asks, accusing.
        
        "Honestly, it's because I saw what you did to that poor man Athen," you reply truthfully.
        
        He lets out a sharp bark of a laugh.
        
        "'Poor Athen?'" he repeats, and then adds in a lower tone to himself, "I'm kind of surprised he's still alive, to be honest."
        
        "He won't be for long; you certainly saw to that," you say.
        
        "I suppose," the man calls to you, "In his retelling of the events that led to me shooting him, he neglected to mention the part where he was going to murder me first?"
        
        You chew on this new information for a moment before responding.
        
        "No, he sort of skipped that part," you admit finally. You chance another peak around the corner; the man has lowered his pistol.
        
        "You can come out, I'm not going to shoot you, I don't just shoot people," he says, a bit annoyed.
        
        "Evidence points to the contrary," you say as you slip from your cover through the doorway to Bay 1E.
        
        You maintain your grip on the pistol in your hand but keep it at your side. The man seems to survey you from the shadows of the dimly lit bay.
        
        "I'll start. I'm Fox. Who're you?"

        "{player_name}," you reply cautiously. "Explain what you're doing here and why you shot Athen."
    
-"I'm a, ah," he clears his throat, "I'm an independent contractor, if you will. I

= bay6D

You head inside Docking Bay 6D. It is immediately apparent that it's empty both of people as well as ships. Odd, you think, as the entirety of the shuttle port operates on a round-the-clock basis. You expected to see some corpses at the very least, but even these are absent. A few cases of cargo line the shuttlestrip, mostly toppled over and spilling their various contents from freeze-dried survival meals to compact machine parts. If it weren't for that, you would hardly be able to tell anything had gone wrong on Cassio from the look of this bay.

Picking through the cargo cases, you don't find anything of interest. Most of it is bulk goods produced by Pandit-Warbeck employees on this station; none of it is easily transportable or worth anything on the grey market.

Is there anything else you want to check while you're here?

    *[Yes, I'll check shuttle control.]
        ->bay6Dshuttlecontrol
    
    *{baychoices < 2}[No, I want to take a look at the other docking bays.]
        ->baychoices
    
    *{baychoices > 1}[No, I should investigate the final docking bay.]
        ->bay1E
        
=bay6Dshuttlecontrol

The red bloom of emergency lights fills the interior of shuttle control, reflecting softly off of the enormous glasticine windows overlooking the bay. Chaos reigns with chairs toppled over and computer screens cracked--but again, there are no bodies to speak of. Perhaps everyone got out safely, you think to yourself.

What do you want to look for here?

    *(weapon) [Look to see if there are any weapons.]
        Though there's nobody around now, you can't help but feel that having a weapon handy wouldn't go amiss. You set about searching for one, hunting through desks drawers and cabinets.
        It's not long before you come across a standard issue pistol for security officers; small, lightweight, but it would get the job done--if you come across a situation where the job needs doing, that is.
    
    *(check_logs) [Check the computer logs for information.] //evidence +
        Fortunately, there's still one computer functioning and logged in to a shuttle control operator's account. You seat yourself at the desk and begin reviewing the most recent logs.
        Strangely, there is no mention of an emergency anywhere. No warnings from shuttle control to inbound ships, no hails from incoming ships to shuttle control. In fact, it appears there weren't any ships scheduled to be in this docking bay for the entirety of the third shift.
        It's not completely unheard of for docking bays to close for maintenance or training every so often, but the timing of it seems... well, incredibly lucky, particularly for Pandit-Warbeck.
        Something about this doesn't feel right, though you can't quite put a finger on it yet. You decide to download the logs to your PDD in case you get off the station and the information becomes pertinent.

-With that done and not much else to explore, you exit shuttle control and leave Docking Bay 6D.

->baychoices

=bay9X

You head inside Docking Bay 9X. {intro.xenolinguist: This is the same one you worked out of as a translator; the entire bay is rented out to the company that contracts you, Astralogistics|A cursory glance doesn't tell you much about what this bay was used for, but the logo for the Astralogistics shipping company is in several conspicuous places, so you suspect it must be rented out to them}. It was a practice started by Pandit-Warbeck about fifteen years ago when Cassio Station lost some of its relevance due to the discovery that its gas giant was rapidly cooling, causing the planet to shrink and making the mining of it that much harder.

Your footsteps echo hollowly as you walk into the small bay; it's empty except for one lone ship at the end. You briefly consider using it to leave the station but nix the idea after considering the fact that you don't know the first thing about flying commercial shuttles. Your best bet is certainly to leave using the escape shuttles, which have been made with the layman in mind.

A sudden and guttural noise behind some empty plasteel shipping crates snaps your attention back to the present. It sounded like someone coughing or choking.

    *[It's not worth the risk. I'll just leave.]
    
    ->END

    *[Investigate the noise; someone could be alive still.]
        Cautiously, you make your way over to the crates and peek behind them.
        
        Laying there on the floor is a young man not older than twenty. He grasps helplessly at his side, where a small, profusely bleeding hole has found a home in his abdomen. At your arrival he jerks his head in your direction and his eyes light up with hope.
        
        "Please--help me," he gasps.
            
            **{not intro.doctor and not intro.unconventional_medic and not intro.combat_medic and not intro.medicine}[See if there's anything I can do.]
            
                You kneel beside him, and he flinches as you peel back the bloody bits of uniform still clinging to his wound.
                
                It looks very serious, and you're not a doctor.

                The man groans and points toward an office at the entrance to the bay. You retrieve it as quickly as your own injury will allow, and kneel beside him again.
                
                }
                
                {intro.xenolinguist:
                
                "Hold on, I have to grab the first-aid kit," you say.
                
                You retrieve it from the front office as quickly as your own injury will allow, and kneel beside him again.
                
                }
                
                Limited experience tells you to treat the wound with a cautery using the field burner in the kit. Although you've never done this before, field burners are made for the average person to operate, so you imagine it can't be too hard.
                
                You pick it up and turn it on. The wide blade at the end begins to heat up, and it steams slightly. You take some antiseptic gauze and sanitize his injury, wiping away the excess blood as he cries out.
                
                    ***[Warn the man this may hurt.]
                    
                        "I'm going to cauterize it. This is going to feel a lot worse," you warn him.
                        
                        "Just--do it," he grunts.
                        
                        You nod and bring the burner to the wound, pressing down. The man yells out loud; you think for a moment he might push you away, but he either lacks the strength to do it or has control enough of his reflexes not to.
                        
                        You pull the burner away after a few seconds and survey your work. It somehow looks worse, but at least the bleeding has stopped on the exterior. The interior might be a different matter.
                        
                        "Thank you," he breaths as tears begin to flow freely down his face.
                        
                        "I did what I could," you reply. "But I'm not a doctor. It's a temporary fix at best."
                    
                    ***[Just get it over with.]
                    
                        Without a warning to him you bring the burner to the wound, pressing down. The man yells out loud; you think for a moment he might push you away, but he either lacks the strength to do it or has control enough of his reflexes not to.

                        "I did what I could," you reply. "But I'm not a doctor. It's a temporary fix at best."
                        
                    ---He nods a little, but his eyes are starting to look glazed.
                    
                    "What's your name?" you ask, trying to keep him focused.
                    
                    "Athen," he murmurs.
                    
                    "My name's {player_name}. Can you tell me what happened to you?" you continue.
                    
                    "He... he shot me," Athen says, a hint of incredulity in his pained tone.
                    
                    You frown; that much was obvious.
                    
                    "Who shot you? And why?" you press him.
                    
                    "The fox, he's shot me--and left me... bastard," Athen replies.
                    
                    "Is he still here?" you ask, glancing towards the doorway nervously.
                    
                    Athen can only manage a nod.
                    
                    You pull yourself to your feet then, coming to a decision.

                    "Thanks. I'll be back," you assure him.

                    "That bad... huh?" he grunts.

                    "What's your name?" you ask, trying to keep him focused.
                    
                    "Athen," he murmurs.
                    
                    "My name's {player_name}. I'm sorry to ask," you say tentatively, "but can you tell me what happened to you?"
                    
                    "He... he shot me," Athen says, a hint of incredulity in his pained tone.
                    
                    You frown; that much was obvious.
                    
                    "Who shot you? And why?" you press him.
                    
                    "The fox, he's shot me--and left me... bastard," Athen replies.
                    
                    "Is he still here?" you ask, glancing towards the bay doors nervously.
                    
                    Athen can only manage a nod.
