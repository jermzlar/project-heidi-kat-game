Much to your surprise, the station corridors are largely empty. You would've thought people would be running around in panic and chaos after such a disaster, and yet you appear to be the only one traversing these lonely halls. Occasionally you see bodies--the mangled corpses of those unfortunate enough to have perished in the blast or shortly after. You could count yourself lucky not to be one of them; although, considering you appear to have been left behind, you're not certain luck factors into it.

As you make your way through Cassio, a thought begins to creep into the back of your mind. It would have taken time to evacuate everyone from the station. How long were you unconscious, then? It must have been more than hours for the station to be this empty. And why weren't you evacuated? Did nobody bother with the courtesy of checking your pulse before declaring you a lost cause?

The questions pile up in your mind until you can't think anymore and a rush of dizziness sweeps over you. You stop just outside the entrance to the shuttle port and grip the wall, waiting as your vision hazes for it to pass. After a moment, it does, and you continue inside, noting that you should probably {intro.doctor or intro.unconventional_medic or intro.combat_medic or intro.medicine: take care of your head injury|get your head looked at} soon.

Seven of the ten docking bays are completely locked down and inaccessible to you without proper authorization, but there are some you can still access.

As you enter 


->END

= bay6D

You head inside Docking Bay 6D. It is immediately apparent that it's empty both of people as well as ships. Odd, you think, as the entirety of the shuttle port operates on a round-the-clock basis. You expected to see some corpses at the very least, but even these are absent. A few cases of cargo line the shuttlestrip, mostly toppled over and spilling their various contents from freeze-dried survival meals to compact machine parts. If it weren't for that, you would hardly be able to tell anything had gone wrong on Cassio from the look of this bay.

Picking through the cargo cases, you don't find anything of interest. Most of it is bulk goods produced by Pandit-Warbeck employees on this station; none of it is easily transportable or worth anything on the grey market.

Is there anything else you want to check while you're here?

    *[Yes, I'll check shuttle control.]

=bay6Dshuttlecontrol

The red bloom of emergency lights fills the interior of shuttle control, reflecting softly off of the enormous glasticine windows overlooking the bay. Chaos reigns with chairs toppled over and computer screens cracked--but again, there are no bodies to speak of. Perhaps everyone got out safely, you think to yourself.

What do you want to look for here?

    *(weapon) [Look to see if there are any weapons.]
        Though there's nobody around now, you can't help but feel that having a weapon handy wouldn't go amiss. You set about searching for one, hunting through desks drawers and cabinets.
        It's not long before you come across a standard issue pistol for security officers; small, lightweight, but it would get the job done--if you come across a situation where the job needs doing, that is.
    
    *(check_logs) [Check the computer logs for information.]
        Fortunately, there's still one computer functioning and logged in to a shuttle control operator's account. You seat yourself at the desk and begin reviewing the most recent logs.
        Strangely, there is no mention of an emergency anywhere. No warnings from shuttle control to inbound ships, no hails from incoming ships to shuttle control. In fact, it appears there weren't any ships scheduled to be in this docking bay for the entirety of the third shift.
        It's not completely unheard of for docking bays to close for maintenance or training every so often, but the timing of it seems... well, incredibly lucky, particularly for Pandit-Warbeck.
        Something about this doesn't feel right, though you can't quite put a finger on it yet. You decide to download the logs to your PDD in case you get off the station and the information becomes pertinent.

-With that done and not much else to explore, you exit shuttle control and leave Docking Bay 6D.

->baychoices

=bay9X

You head inside Docking Bay 9X. {intro.xenolinguist: This is the same one you worked out of as a translator; the entire bay is rented out to the company that contracts you, Astralogistics|A cursory glance doesn't tell you much about what this bay was used for, but the logo for the Astralogistics shipping company is in several conspicuous places, so you suspect it must be rented out to them}. It was a practice started by Pandit-Warbeck about fifteen years ago when Cassio Station lost some of its relevance due to the discovery that its gas giant was rapidly cooling, causing the planet to shrink and making the mining of it that much harder.

Your footsteps echo hollowly as you walk into the small bay; it's empty except for one lone ship at the end. You briefly consider using it to leave the station but nix the idea after considering the fact that you don't know the first thing about flying commercial shuttles. Your best bet is certainly to leave using the escape shuttles, which have been made with the layman in mind.

A sudden and guttural noise behind some empty plasteel shipping crates snaps your attention back to the present. It sounded like someone coughing or choking.

    *[It's not worth the risk. I'll just leave.]
    
    ->END

    *[Investigate the noise; someone could be alive still.]
        Cautiously, you make your way over to the crates and peek behind them.
        
        Laying there on the floor is a young man not older than twenty. He grasps helplessly at his side, where a small, profusely bleeding hole has found a home in his abdomen. At your arrival he jerks his head in your direction and his eyes light up with hope.
        
        "Please--help me," he gasps.

                It looks very serious, and you're not a doctor.

                The man groans and points toward an office at the entrance to the bay. You retrieve it as quickly as your own injury will allow, and kneel beside him again.

                Limited experience tells you to treat the wound with a cautery using the field burner in the kit. Although you've never done this before, field burners are made for the average person to operate, so you imagine it can't be too hard.
                
                You pick it up and turn it on. The wide blade at the end begins to heat up, and it steams slightly. You take some antiseptic gauze and sanitize his injury, wiping away the excess blood as he cries out.

                        "Just--do it," he grunts.
                        
                        You nod and bring the burner to the wound, pressing down. The man yells out loud; you think for a moment he might push you away, but he either lacks the strength to do it or has control enough of his reflexes not to.
                        
                        You pull the burner away after a few seconds and survey your work. It somehow looks worse, but at least the bleeding has stopped on the exterior. The interior might be a different matter.
                        
                        "Thank you," he breaths as tears begin to flow freely down his face.
                        
                        "I did what I could," you reply. "But I'm not a doctor. It's a temporary fix at best."

                        Without a warning to him you bring the burner to the wound, pressing down. The man yells out loud; you think for a moment he might push you away, but he either lacks the strength to do it or has control enough of his reflexes not to.

                    You frown; that much was obvious.
                    
                    "Who shot you? And why?" you press him.
                    
                    "The fox, he's shot me--and left me... bastard," Athen replies.

                            Athen nods, his expression vacant.
                        
                            {not weapon:
                        
                            <>"Do you know where I could get a pistol or something?" you try.
                        
                            "Office, in the locker... combination is 0-6-1-2-8," Athen says, pointing in the direction of the front office.
                    
                            You consider him for a moment.
                            
                            "Thanks. I would say I owe you, but..." you trail off, and he lets out a short, hollow laugh.
                            
                            "Leave me... to die. Just make sure he does... too," he says with some difficulty.
                        
                            You assure him you will see to it and then leave.
                        
                            }
                        
                    Outside in the main hall, there is not sight nor sound of anyone else around. Then comes the sound of a pistol shot fired from one of the bays at the end; the only one not locked down is Docking Bay 1E.

            **[Tell him I'm sorry, but I can't help.]
            
                You shake your head slowly at the young man.
                
                "I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do," you {not intro.doctor and not intro.unconventional_medic and not intro.combat_medic and not intro.medicine: say|lie}.
                
                You turn around and begin to leave; the young man struggles for breath as he wails for you to wait. You can't see him anymore as you walk out of the docking bay, but the cracks in his fading voice tells you tears have reached his eyes in his desperation. The docking bay door slides shut behind you, and you hear him no more.

                You lied to him when you said you couldn't help him. Why was that?
                    
                    ***[It's every person for themselves now.]
                    
                        You may have sworn an oath to help those you could, but extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures. You can't stop for every dying person left on this station--you'd likely never get off. Part of your work is to make calls like that.
                        
                        You just hope it was the right one.

                        It was obvious even from a glance that his wound would almost certainly be fatal. Even if you had all of the personnel and equipment you needed, he still might not survive, and without it he's as good as dead. Part of your work is to make calls like that.
