~whos_talking = "nobody"
You and Sunday enter the room adjacent to the laboratory. The red emergency lights here flicker periodically. There are about five computers still working here, each looking very similarly perched on top of identical desks. Of the other three inoperable computers, one has a cracked screen, one has collided with the floor, and one appears to be smoking faintly. {intro.scientist: You are slightly pained at the sight of the data room, having been previously regaled by fellow scientists about how many years it took each of them to convince Elysium to grant funding for various equipment upgrades.}

~whos_talking = "mc"
"What did Lin mean when they said we'd both find what we're looking for in here?" you ask Sunday.

~whos_talking = "sunday"
~character_a = "sunday"
"Haven't the faintest idea," Sunday says; although, you're fairly certain she is lying.

    ~whos_talking_button = "mc"
    *["I'm really tired of being kept in the dark."]
        "I'm really tired of being kept in the dark, here," you huff.
        ~whos_talking = "sunday"
        ~character_a = "sunday"
        "Get used to it," she says with all the empathy of a sea cucumber.
        
    ~whos_talking_button = "mc"
    *["Even if you don't tell me, I'm going to find out."]
        "Even if you don't tell me, I'm going to find out when you find it here," you point out.
        ~whos_talking = "sunday"
        ~character_a = "sunday"
        "Not if I can help it," she replies{rel_sunday >65:, then adds, "I'm looking out for you, you know."|.}

~whos_talking = "nobody"
The two of you fall silent as Sunday sets about searching the room. She, for her part, seems to know exactly where she's going as she heads towards a desk at the far corner with a computer. She sits and almost immediately begins typing and clicking furiously. 

~character_a = "nobody"

~whos_talking = "nobody"

~sound_cue = "boopbeepboop 1"

You likewise seat yourself at one of the desks and begin to enter your station log-in information. <>

{intro.security or intro.technician or intro.scientist:

~whos_talking = "nobody"
With your credentials, you should have no trouble authorizing shuttle departure from here.
}

{intro.doctor or intro.xenolinguist:

~whos_talking = "nobody"
With your credentials, you're not entirely sure you'll be able to authorize shuttle departure from here.

~whos_talking = "nobody"
As though she read your mind, Sunday calls for your attention and tells you hers, adding, <>
"You'll need that to authorize departure."
} <>

~whos_talking = "nobody"
Upon signing on to the station hub, it takes you a moment to find the command controls you're looking for. 

...\\\\\\\\\...

...\\\\\\\\\...

    *[Select global authorization controls for short-range shuttle bay.]
    -> departure_authorization

= departure_authorization

~whos_talking = "nobody"
You are required to enter {intro.doctor or intro.xenolinguist: Sunday's|your} crendetials several more times as you navigate authorizing departures, but the relatively straightforward process is finished in a few minutes.

~whos_talking = "mc"
"Okay, I think we're good to go," you say triumphantly to Sunday.

~whos_talking = "nobody"
You glance back at the screen, and something catches your eye.

    ~whos_talking_button = "nobody"
    *[There's a folder named "Jenusian Export Logs" here...]
    There's a folder named "Jenusian Export Logs" here, which is strange, considering the Jenusians have refused the majority of exports from Elysium since the war in '83. What could the company possibly be trading to them?
    -> export_logs

= export_logs

~whos_talking = "nobody"
You open the folder and a long list of files appears, each with a syntax that includes what appears to be a person's name in addition to a recent date. Some of these names look familiar.

    *(benjoe) [Select the file "BENJOE_DERSON"]
    *(hallee) [Select the file "RENCE_HALLEE"]
    *(sones) [Select the file "MATHY_SONES"]

-
~whos_talking = "nobody"
You click on the file to open it, and up comes a document that looks something like a profile of a person--a person you recognize, in fact. You remember {benjoe: Benjoe}{hallee: Hallee}{sones: Sones}; he lived in a room not more than three doors down from you. On your first day on the station he offered you a drink at one of the watering holes; you got to talking, and eventually you became good friends--until about a month ago. You were supposed to meet for a game of Hidive one day, and he didn't show. When you asked around after him, you were told he was simply reassigned. It had been rather upsetting that he didn't bother to tell you.

~whos_talking = "nobody"
You scroll through the profile. It's a collection of physical descriptions, personality markers, mental health evaluations, and other personal points of data about {benjoe: Benjoe}{hallee: Hallee}{sones: Sones}.

~whos_talking = "nobody"
Towards the bottom of the document are several shipping manifests indicating cargo exported from Cassio to another planet in the system, Valbaara II. But Valbaara II is a dead planet. You recall it was slated for terraforming, but after the war it was put on hold indefinitely. And the shipping manifests don't indicate the nature of the cargo, unless...

~whos_talking = "nobody"
As you continue to scroll through profiles, you start to feel sick as your mind rapidly connects the dots. You don't see any other way around it: Elysium, for whatever reason, is covering up the fact that they're freighting their own low-level employees to some backwater planet in the system--though for what purpose remains to be seen.

You connect your PDD with the computer and begin downloading as much information as possible. It occurs to you that Sunday works for Elysium, and you wonder if she knows about this.

~whos_talking = "nobody"
It's a moment before you realize she has come up behind you.

~whos_talking = "sunday"
~character_a = "sunday"
"Shit."

    *[Confront Sunday--physically, if necessary.]
    ->physical_confront
    *[Confront Sunday peacefully.]
    -> peaceful_confront

= physical_confront

~whos_talking = "nobody"
You only have a few moments to react. In one swift move you jump to your feet and turn to face Sunday, holding your fists up in preparation for a fight. Sunday draws her weapon and immediately trains it on you, something you hadn't really considered. It appears you've brought your fists to a light-gun fight.

~whos_talking = "sunday"
~character_a = "sunday"
"What the hell are you doing?" Sunday asks, motioning to you with the pistol.

    ~whos_talking_button = "mc"
    *["I know what Elysium is doing."]
        "I know what Elysium is doing, and I'm not going to let you take me," you say, accusation strong in your voice.
        ~whos_talking = "sunday"
        ~character_a = "sunday"
        "Take you? {MNC_sunday.sour: Darling|Sweetheart}, I'm the very last of your worries now that you know about this," Sunday almost laughs.
        
    ~whos_talking_button = "mc"
    *["You work for Elysium; did you know about this?"]
        "You work for Elysium; did you know about this?" you ask, accusation strong in your voice. 
        ~whos_talking = "sunday"
        ~character_a = "sunday"
        "I did," Sunday replies solemnly.

~whos_talking = "nobody"
She drops her pistol to her side. You maintain the pretense of a fighting stance for a moment longer, but it becomes apparent that she has no intention of doing you any harm--at least for the moment.

~whos_talking = "nobody"
You stand from the desk and turn to face Sunday. You motion to the computer, where you still have the shipping manifests pulled up.

        "I know what Elysium is doing," you say, trying to hold the accusation from seeping into your voice.

A hint of regret crosses her face.

The two of you exit the data room back into the laboratory. Sunday doesn't seem interested in sticking around; she exits almost immediately and without a goodbye to you or the android.

You meet her eyes for a moment, then nod.

~whos_talking = "mc"
"All right, Sunday, I believe you."

~whos_talking = "sunday"
~character_a = "sunday"
"That's it, then?" she says. "I guess we should get out of here."

~whos_talking = "mc"
"I guess so," you reply.

~background = "laboratory"

~whos_talking = "nobody"
The two of you exit the data room back into the laboratory. Though Sunday carries herself with her usual composure, you can tell she is relieved.

Lin walks up beside you.

~whos_talking = "lin"
"I see you both found what you were looking for," they say.

{intro.get_phat_loots and came_from (->dont_believe):

~whos_talking = "mc"
"Actually, about that..." you say, glancing over at them. "I've authorized departures for short-range shuttles, but I'm still keen on starting my new life ahead of the game once I get out of here, if you know what I mean."

~whos_talking = "lin"
~character_b = "lin"
"Yes, I can intuit that you are still interested in material gain," Lin says. "Rest assured that I possess many multitudes of delicate data and information that I am sure we could find a suitably generous buyer for--once we are out of here?"
 }

 "Not sure she did," you reply. "It might be a problem after I get off Cassio."

 Lin considers this.

 "Perhaps I could be of assistance--once we are out of here?"
}

{came_from (->believe):

"We did. Thank you for your assistance," Sunday says kindly.

Lin considers this.

"Perhaps I could be of more assistance--once we are out of here?"
}

-~whos_talking = "nobody"
The uptick in the android's voice at the end indicates the question they are asking--whether they would be joining {came_from (->believe): the two of} you or not.

 ~whos_talking = "mc"
"I don't see why not," you say.

~whos_talking = "nobody"
Lin nods.

~whos_talking = "nobody"
After a moment you note that you are likely running out of time before the station's inevitable demise, and so {came_from (->believe): the three of you|the two of you} exit the laboratory without further discussion.

It's been a while since you awoke in your room, and a lot has happened since then.

~whos_talking = "nobody"
Have your priorities changed amid the revelations you've uncovered?

    ~whos_talking_button = "nobody"
    *(priority_tellall) [Yes. The public needs to know about what Elysium is doing, and I'm going to tell them.]
        ~compassion_selfserve -= 6
        ~communal_independent -= 6
        Your number one priority in the moment is, of course, getting safely off of Cassio wholly or at least mostly intact. But as soon as you are safely established, you know you're going to have to get this information into the right hands.

    ~whos_talking_button = "nobody"
    *(priority_stopelysium) [Yes. What Elysium is doing is wrong, and I'm going to stop them.]
        ~compassion_selfserve -= 6
        ~communal_independent += 6
        Your number one priority in the moment is, of course, getting safely off of Cassio wholly or at least mostly intact. But as soon as you are safely established, you know you're going to have to find out who's responsible at Elysium and stop them.

    ~whos_talking_button = "nobody"
    *(priority_gototop) [Yes. I have a feeling whatever's going on is a lot bigger than Elysium, and I need to find out more.]
        ~compassion_selfserve += 6
        ~communal_independent += 6
        Your number one priority in the moment is, of course, getting safely off of Cassio wholly or at least mostly intact. But as soon as you are safely established, you know you're going to have to get to the bottom of this mess--which will probably mean going straight to the top.

    ~whos_talking_button = "nobody"
    *{intro.get_phat_loots} [No; I'm still mostly concerned with making sure I get out of here with some extra scratch.]
        ~compassion_selfserve += 6
        ~communal_independent += 6
        Your number one priority in the moment is, of course, getting safely off of Cassio wholly or at least mostly intact. But as soon as you are safely established, you know you're going to have to have a chat with Lin about getting a cut of the sales of their multitudes of likely illicit data.
        
    ~whos_talking_button = "nobody"
    *{intro.find_out_wha_happe} [No; I haven't found out what caused the destruction on Cassio yet. Before I do anything else, I need to figure that out.]
        ~compassion_selfserve -= 6
        ~communal_independent += 6
        Your number one priority in the moment is, of course, getting safely off of Cassio wholly or at least mostly intact. But as soon as you are safely established, you know you'll be searching for information about the body snatchers and the destruction of Cassio.
    
    ~whos_talking_button = "nobody"
    *{intro.help_scared_injured} [No; although it seems like there aren't many people left on the station, my priority is still to help as many as I can.]
        ~compassion_selfserve -= 6
        ~communal_independent -= 6
        Your number one priority in the moment is, of course, getting safely off of Cassio wholly or at least mostly intact. But you want to make sure as many people as possible get to safety as well. Once you are all out of danger, you can start to think about your next move.
        
    ~whos_talking_button = "nobody"
    *{intro.get_tf_outta_here} [No; I can't think about anything else until I'm out of here along with Sunday and Lin.]
        ~compassion_selfserve += 6
        ~communal_independent -= 6
        Your number one priority is still, of course, getting safely off of Cassio wholly or at least mostly intact along with your companions. Once you are all safely established, you might be able to start thinking about your next move.
        
    ~whos_talking_button = "nobody"
    *[Fuck priorities. I've had enough intrigue and excitement to last a lifetime; I want to get the hell off of this station and never think about any of this again.]
        ~compassion_selfserve += 12
        ~communal_independent += 12
        Your number one priority is, of course, getting the hell off of Cassio. Once you are safely off, you won't have to think about anything that's happened today ever again.
